              <p>My name is Olga. I'm 31.</p>
              <p>I took interest in programming about a year ago. I started my path with trying to learn C#, but soon switched to a more popular programming language - JavaScript. I used every source of information to gather knowledge: books, courses, documentation, articles, videos, etc. To be able to understand more I started taking english classes, and gradually with more and more practice, I realized that I want to be involved in this professional sphere.</p>

              <h4>Task</h4>
              <p>Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.</p>
              <code>
                function descendingOrder(n){<br>
                  let myString=n.toString();<br>
                  let myArray=[];<br>
                  myArray = myString.split('');<br>
                  myArray.sort();<br>
                  myArray.reverse();<br>
                  myString=myArray.join('')<br>
                  return parseInt(myString);<br>
                }
